# Tab Works Like As It Should Be

This Obsidian plugin changes the Tab key behavior:

- **Tab** → inserts a literal tab character `\t`
- **Shift+Tab** → removes one leading tab from all selected lines

No auto-indentation. No internet access. No file access.

## Safety
- Does not read/write outside the editor buffer.
- No network requests.
- No dynamic code execution.
